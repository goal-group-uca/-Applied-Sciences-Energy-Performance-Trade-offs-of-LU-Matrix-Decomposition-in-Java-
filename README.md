# [Applied Sciences] Energy-Performance-Trade-offs-of-LU-Matrix-Decomposition-in-Java-
Energy–Performance Trade-offs of LU Matrix Decomposition in Java Across Heterogeneous Hardware and Operating Systems

This repository contains the experimental data for the project, organized by execution time and energy consumption metrics.

## Repository Structure

The data is divided into two main directories:

### 1. `/time`
This folder contains the files related to computational performance.
* **Headers:** `matrix_size`, `threads_used`, `seconds`

### 2. `/consumption`
This folder contains the files related to energy efficiency and power draw.
* **Headers:** `matrix_size`, `threads_used`, `seconds`, `joules`, `mean_watts`
